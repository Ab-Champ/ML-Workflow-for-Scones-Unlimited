## INTRODUCTION
In this project, we have built an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders.
Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.
The image classification model can help the team in a variety of ways in their operating environment:
detecting people and vehicles in video feeds from roadways, better support routing for their engagement on social media, detecting defects in their scones, and many more
I have used AWS Sagemaker and its services to build the model and create a workflow to put the project in production and monitor its working thoroughly.
